# 什么是逻辑

# Sentenial logic
## Well-formed formulae
1. Every atomic sentence is a wff.
2. If A is a wff, then ¬A is a wff of SL.
3. If A and B are wffs, then (A & B) is a wff.
4. If A and B are wffs, then (A ∨ B) is a wff.
5. If A and B are wffs, then (A → B) is a wff.
6. If A and B are wffs, then (A ↔ B) is a wff.
7. All and only wffs of SL can be generated by applications of these rules

# Quantified logic
## Well-formed formulae
1. Every atomic formula is a wff.
2. If A is a wff, then ¬A is a wff.
3. If A and B are wffs, then (A & B), is a wff.
4. If A and B are wffs, (A ∨ B) is a wff.
5. If A and B are wffs, then (A → B) is a wff.
6. If A and B are wffs, then (A ↔ B) is a wff.
7. If A is a wff, x is a variable, A contains at least one occurrence of x , and
A contains no x -quantifiers, then ∀xA is a wff.
8. If A is a wff, x is a variable, A contains at least one occurrence of x , and
A contains no x -quantifiers, then ∃xA is a wff.
9. All and only wffs of QL can be generated by applications of these rules.
