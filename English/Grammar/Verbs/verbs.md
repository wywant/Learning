# auxiliary verbs  
An auxiliary verb is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it appears—for example, 
to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc. 
Auxiliary verbs usually accompany a main verb. The main verb provides the main semantic content of the clause. 
An example is the verb have in the sentence I have finished my dinner. 
Here, the main verb is finish, and the auxiliary have helps to express the perfect aspect.
Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs. 
Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries.
They may be glossed with the abbreviation AUX.

# Continuous and progressive aspects  
The continuous and progressive aspects (abbreviated cont and prog) are grammatical aspects that express incomplete action ("to do") or state ("to be") in progress at a specific time: they are non-habitual, imperfective aspects.

# perfect tense  
The perfect tense or aspect (abbreviated perf or prf) is a verb form that indicates that an action or circumstance occurred earlier than the time under consideration, often focusing attention on the resulting state rather than on the occurrence itself. An example of a perfect construction is I have made dinner: although this gives information about a prior action (my making the dinner), the focus is likely to be on the present consequences of that action (the fact that the dinner is now ready). The word perfect in this sense means "completed" (from Latin perfectum, which is the perfect passive participle of the verb perficere "to complete").

# perfective aspect  
The perfective aspect (abbreviated pfv), sometimes called the aoristic aspect,[1] is a grammatical aspect used to describe an action viewed as a simple whole—a unit without interior composition. The perfective aspect is distinguished from the imperfective aspect, which presents an event as having internal structure (such as ongoing, continuous, or habitual actions). The term perfective should be distinguished from perfect

# Progressive constructions  
Progressive constructions denote ongoing activity at a specific point of time or continuous activity over an extent of time. All verbal constructions can be made progressive (e.g. "I have written" → "I have been writing"), and these constructions are very common. Progressive constructions are also known as "continuous".
