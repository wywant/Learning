# auxiliary verbs  
An auxiliary verb is a verb that adds functional or grammatical meaning to the clause in which it appearsâ€”for example, 
to express tense, aspect, modality, voice, emphasis, etc. 
Auxiliary verbs usually accompany a main verb. The main verb provides the main semantic content of the clause. 
An example is the verb have in the sentence I have finished my dinner. 
Here, the main verb is finish, and the auxiliary have helps to express the perfect aspect.
Some sentences contain a chain of two or more auxiliary verbs. 
Auxiliary verbs are also called helping verbs, helper verbs, or (verbal) auxiliaries.
They may be glossed with the abbreviation AUX.
