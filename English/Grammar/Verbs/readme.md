# inflected forms  

Most verbs have three or four inflected forms in addition to the base form: 
  *  a third-person singular present tense form in -(e)s (writes, botches), 
  * a present participle and gerund form in -ing (writing), 
  * a past tense (wrote), 
  * and – though often identical to the past tense form – a past participle (written).
